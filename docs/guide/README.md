Introduction
Features
Friendly UI: Front-end page is provided and developers can manage their task, monitor the status, check the logs online, etc.

Abundant Timing Strategies: Four timing strategies are supported, including CRON expression, fixed rate, fixed delay and OpenAPI which allows you to define your own scheduling policies, such as delaying execution.

Multiple Execution Mode: Four execution modes are supported, including stand-alone, broadcast, Map and MapReduce. Distributed computing resource could be utilized in MapReduce mode, try the magic out here!

Workflow(DAG) Support: Both job dependency management and data communications between jobs are supported.

Extensive Processor Support: Developers can write their processors in Java, Shell, Python, and will subsequently support multilingual scheduling via HTTP.

Powerful Disaster Tolerance: As long as there are enough computing nodes, configurable retry policies make it possible for your task to be executed and finished successfully.

High Availability & High Performance: PowerJob supports unlimited horizontal expansion. It's easy to achieve high availability and performance by deploying as many PowerJob server and worker nodes.

Applicable scenes
Timed tasks, for example, allocating e-coupons on 9 AM every morning.
Broadcast tasks, for example, broadcasting to the cluster to clear logs.
MapReduce tasks, for example, speeding up certain job like updating large amounts of data.
Delayed tasks, for example, processing overdue orders.
Customized tasks, triggered with OpenAPI.
Online trial
